Project Summary and Findings

Data Description

Dataset: Daily closing prices of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock from Yahoo Finance.

Period: Last 10 years of historical data.

Transformation: Log transformation applied to stabilize variance.

Exploratory Analysis

Visualization: Time series plot reveals a strong upward trend and recurring seasonal fluctuations.

STL Decomposition: LOESS-based decomposition identified clear trend, seasonal, and residual components.

Stationarity and Differencing

ADF Test: Initial series fails stationarity check (p-value > 0.05).

Differencing: First-order differencing produced a stationary series (p-value < 0.05).

Model Building

Order Selection: ACF and PACF plots guided the choice of ARIMA(p,d,q) parameters.

ARIMA Models Tested: (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,1,1), (2,1,0), (0,1,2), (2,1,1), (2,1,2).

SARIMA: Seasonal parameters added (P,D,Q,s) to capture recurring patterns.

Forecasting Results

ARIMA vs. SARIMA:

Both models generated 30-day ahead forecasts.

Visual comparison shows SARIMA better captures seasonality and trend shifts.

Key Insights

SARIMA slightly outperformed ARIMA on key error metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE).

Residual Diagnostics confirm that residuals behave like white noise for the chosen models.

Parsimony: When error metrics were similar, simpler models were preferred based on lower parameter count.

Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates the end-to-end workflow for time series forecasting. The SARIMA model was selected as the final model due to its superior handling of seasonality and comparable accuracy with a reasonable level of complexity.
