Model Evaluation

1. Residual Diagnostics

ACF/PACF of Residuals: No significant autocorrelations beyond lag 0, indicating residuals behave like white noise.

Ljung-Box Test: p-values > 0.05 for both ARIMA and SARIMA residuals, confirming independence.

2. Error Metrics

SARIMA(p,d,q)

Replace (p,d,q) with selected orders and update metrics after running scripts.

3. Information Criteria

AIC:

ARIMA: AAA.AA

SARIMA: BBB.BB

BIC:

ARIMA: CCC.CC

SARIMA: DDD.DD

Lower values indicate better trade-off between fit and complexity.

4. Model Selection Considerations

Parsimony: Prefer models with fewer parameters when performance is similar.

Forecast Accuracy: SARIMA chosen for marginally lower error metrics and improved seasonal capture.

Complexity vs. Benefit: ARIMA offers simplicity; SARIMA adds complexity for better seasonal modeling.

Next Steps: Deploy the selected model for live forecasting and monitor performance over time, retraining as needed.
